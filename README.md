The soundscapes of Kaisaniemi Park presented with photographs and sound effects.

We want to explore how photographs together with sound effects can bring the Kaisaniemi park's history alive for the tourist and
a citizen, to tell the long history and many aspects of the park.

The soundscapes could be developed further by addind people's stories and memories, news articles or facts read aloud,
over the sound effects. For example the picture of an empty street and a walking sound could be dramatised further with
the news of women being afraid in Kaisaniemi park at night.

Photographs: Finna, Sound effects: Freesound, Yle Archives. Map:

Group: Julia Donner, Aalto University. Katja Hilska-Kein√§nen, Yle Archives. Juuso Lehtinen, Karttalehtinen.
